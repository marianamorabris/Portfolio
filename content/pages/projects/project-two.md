**Katto: Rising Tides** is a first-person adventure game developed by a team of students from ESAT (Escuela Superior de Arte y TecnologÃ­a). Set in a beautifully crafted fantasy world, the game invites players to explore an expansive, immersive environment while exploring a greco-roman fantasy ambience. As the protagonist, players navigate through different areas, combining exploration with light platforming mechanics.

> Development and Artistic Work

The game was developed as a final project, showcasing the team's talents across multiple disciplines, including concept art, 3D modeling, environmental design, and programming. The focus on atmospheric world-building is a standout feature, with particular attention given to the game's detailed landscapes and environmental storytelling.


The work done on Katto: Rising Tides reflects a strong collaboration between artists, programmers and designers, where each member contributed to building an experience that balances aesthetic beauty with gameplay depth.
