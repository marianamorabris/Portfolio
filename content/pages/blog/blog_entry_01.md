    title: THE SEA QUEEN
    text: >
      This was a little project I made In few days, It all started with a quick
      sketch in photoshop of a simple design, a sea-like humanoid creature that
      inspired me to do a little warm up in zbrush to mantain my familiarity
      with the program. This helped me discover new materials and techniques to
      use in the Zbrush.
